# Chat Enhancement Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented AI chat with project content awareness. The system now:

1. **Loads project context** - Retrieves all frames and metadata from ChromaDB
2. **Formats content for AI** - Provides structured information about:
   - Total videos, clips, and frames
   - Mood distribution
   - Common visual elements (tags)
   - Technical specifications
   - Video-specific highlights with key moments

3. **Enables meaningful conversations** - Users can:
   - Ask about available content
   - Get suggestions based on actual footage
   - Understand what types of shots they have
   - Brainstorm ideas before creating storyboards

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

1. **backend/vector.py**
   - Added `get_frames_by_project()` method to retrieve all frames for a project

2. **backend/project.py**
   - Added `get_project_content_context()` method for comprehensive content analysis
   - Fixed JSON parsing issue with tags that were already parsed

3. **backend/main.py**
   - Enhanced chat endpoint to include project context
   - Added `format_project_content_for_ai()` function
   - Improved error handling with detailed logging

## Usage Examples

```python
# Ask about project content
"What videos do I have in my project?"
"What kind of shots are available?"
"Show me what moods are captured"

# Get creative suggestions
"Suggest ideas for an energetic montage"
"What clips would work for a calm intro?"
"Help me find crowd scenes"

# Then create storyboard
"Create a 30-second video with the best moments"
"Generate a storyboard focusing on energetic scenes"
```

## Known Issues

1. **Language mixing** - Qwen2.5 sometimes outputs in multiple languages when system prompt is English but user asks in Danish
2. **No conversation memory** - Each request is independent, no context from previous messages

## Next Steps

1. Add conversation history tracking
2. Implement language consistency (force single language output)
3. Add more sophisticated content analysis (scene detection, object recognition)
4. Enable saving chat conversations with projects
